# MPSKitParallel.jl

Contains code to utilize multi-processing to speed up MPSKit.jl computations.
The framework is built upon [TensorKit.jl](https://github.com/jutho/TensorKit.jl) and [MPSKit.jl](https://github.com/QuantumKitHub/MPSKit.jl), but is an independent project and not affiliated with the TensorKit.jl developers.
